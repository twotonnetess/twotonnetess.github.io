title: About Me

Working in the most competitive and notable astronomy institutes in Europe, and the largest, 
current European space telescope, has given me strong team working skills, with a focus on 
attaining the end goal using innovative techniques and tools. I now want to continue to develop 
these skills in a data science environment.
