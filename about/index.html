<h1> About Me </h1>
<p>
Most recently I have spent the past 7 months backpacking through Latin America. It was a wonderful trip one of the highlights of which was teaching in a school in Bogotá (see <a href="../communications">Communication</a> for more). 
</p>

<p>
I am currently looking for my next position, a job that I can throw myself into and make use of problem solving, analytical thinking and communication skills. 
</p>


<h3> Background </h3>
<p> Last April I completed a 2 year Post-doc in Leiden University, working with Anthony Brown on the development of the Gaia archive while continuing my research in star formation.
</p>

<p>
Before that I successfully defended my thesis in October 2013 on Accretion Variability in Young Stellar Objects. (Graduated December 2014). During my thesis I spent some time in a number of institutes. I began my PhD in Ireland, under a joint scholarship between the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies (DIAS) and Armagh Observatory, working with Tom Ray, Aleks Scholz and Jorick Vink. After being awarded the ESO studentship, I continued my studies at the ESO headquarters, Garching, Germany.

<h3> Footnote </h3>

<p>
<b> Gráinne </b> is pronounced <i> Gronya </i>. It one of those Irish names that does not travel very well. However I travel well, and really enjoy it. I am also a water sports enthusiast (currently kite surfing), love reading novels, hiking, skiing, learning about brand new areas (philosophy at the moment), cooking and after a number of years in Germany and the Netherlands I have turned into a beer snob.
