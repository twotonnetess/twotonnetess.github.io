<h1> About Me </h1>
I have spent the past 7 months traveling through Latin America. During this time I spent three great weeks teaching science at a primary school in Bogota, Colombia. Over these three weeks, myself and a colleague, introduced the children to the scientific method through a lunar crater experiment and taught them about the origins of the solar system and the basics of computer programming. We gave a full schedule of classes (in spanish) to each class from 2nd to 6th (6-12 year olds). This was an incredibility challenging but rewarding experience and is one of the highlights of the trip.

I most recently completed a 2 year Post-doc in Leiden University, working with Anthony Brown on the development of the Gaia archive while continuing my research in star formation.

<h3> Background </h3>
I successfully defended my thesis in October 2013 on Accretion Variability in Young Stellar Objects. (Graduated December 2014). During my thesis I spent some time in a number of institutes. I began my Phd in Ireland, under a joint scholarship between the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies (DIAS) and Armagh Observatory, working with Tom Ray, Aleks Scholz and Jorick Vink. After being awarded the ESO studentship, I continued my studies at the ESO headquarters, Garching, Germany.
