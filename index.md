 <b> Gráinne </b> is pronounced <i> Gronya </i>. One of many Irish names that do not travel very well.


<p>
My collection of degrees include a BAmod(Science) in Theoretical Physics (Trinity College Dublin), a masters in mathematics (Uni. of Cambridge) and a PhD in astronomy (Queen's Uni. Belfast, with ESO (Munich), DIAS (Dublin), Armagh Observatory (N. Ireland)). I have postdoc experience in Leiden Observatory (NL) in the Gaia data processing consortium, teaching experience in Colombia (see <a href="../communications">Communication</a>) and for a time I was city astronomer in Dundee (Scotland).  

At the moment I am preparing for my biggest adventure, racing solo across the Atlantic in Sept. 2025 - the first Irish woman to do it in a mini 6.50 - while also working as a data scientist in pharma.
