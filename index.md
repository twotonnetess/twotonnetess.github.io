My collection of degrees include a BAmod(Science) in Theoretical Physics (Trinity College Dublin), a masters in mathematics (Uni. of Cambridge) and a PhD in astronomy (Queen's Uni.

I have postdoc experience in Leiden Observatory (NL) in the Gaia data processing consortium, teaching experience in Colombia (see <a href="../communications">Communication</a>) and for a time I was city astronomer in Dundee (Scotland).
