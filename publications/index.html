<figcaption> Fig1. - Time-series of the Hα emission of RW Aur after the start of the dimming event. (Fig. 5 in paper). This emission demonstrates that the star is a strong accretor (i.e. still growing in mass), and weaker blue shifter emission then was observed before the dimming event. </figcaption>

<h4> RW Aur is an interesting young star that has seen much attention recently due to some enigmatic activity. We used both photometric and spectroscopic observations taken before and during the large dimming event in 2015 to investigate it's cause. </h4> </br>
 
<h4> My role in this project was to analyse the IFU observations taken with FRODOSpec. The python code used to reduce and analyse the data can be found <a href="https://github.com/twotonnetess/RWAUR_Bozhinova"> here</a>. Fig. 1 shows a plot I made from these data showing the changes observed in the Halpha line during the dimming event. </h4> </br>

<h3>  Pre- and Post-burst Radio Observations of the Class 0 Protostar HOPS 383 in Orion <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...806L..32G "> [ApJL 2015] </a> </h3> 
Authors: Galvan-Madrid,R.; Rodriguez, L. F.; Liu, H.; <b> Costigan </b>, G.; Palau,A; Zapata, L. A.; Loinard, L. (APJL 2016, 806,  2, L32, 5) <a href=" http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...806L..32G"> [Full Paper]</a> </br>

<h4> A large infrared outburst was observed Hops 383 between 2004 and 2008, which was associated with a huge increase infalling mass onto the central star. These accretion bursts are thought to be closely realted with changes in the jet emission. However, we analysed archival VLA observations which showed now large variations in emission over this time period. 
Sugesting these two phenomenon are not as tightly correlated as previously thought.  </br>

<h3> Temperaments of young stars: Rapid mass-accretion rate changes inT Tauri and Herbig Ae stars <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440.3444C"> [2014]</a> </h3> 
Authors: <b> Costigan </b>, G., Vink, J.,  Scholz, A., Ray, T., Testi, L. (MNRAS 440, 4, 3444-3461) <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440.3444C"> [Full Paper]</a> </br>


<h4> With observations of 15 young active stars (T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars) we investigated variations on short timescales, minutes, hours, weeks, up to longer timescales of years. To do this we used an emission line closely associated with accretion, Hα (see Fig. 1 for example profile) </br>

In order to perform a uniform analysis over the entire sample (which spanned a large mass range 0.1 to 5 solar masses) we fitted observed accretion luminosities and line luminosties for a number of different data sets. This allowed us to derive a new relation which we then used for the entire sample. This fit can be seen to the right in Fig. 2. The code used to create this figure can be found <a href="https://github.com/twotonnetess/Costigan_2014"> here </a> </h4>  </br>

<h4> Variability studies often target variable stars, so many of them do not give a true picture of a 'normal variability'. This study specifically set out to study a unbiased sample of young stellar objects in the Chameleon region. </br>

Fig. 3 shows this study put in context with other variable studies (which used similar activity traces i.e. optical emission lines associated with accretion). Together all of these works suggest that variations occur on timescales cloes to the rotation periods of these stars. This is a likely situation as these systems are often non-axial symmetric and so any rotation will change the viewing angle of the mass flows onto the surface of the star. </h4>  </br>
